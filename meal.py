# In a real application, this would involve:
# 1. Loading a pre-trained BERT model (e.g., 'bert-base-uncased')
# 2. Fine-tuning it on a dataset of food descriptions and nutrition facts.
# 3. Using it for regression to predict calorie and sugar intake.

# For demonstration, we'll use a very simple heuristic.
# This part would require significant NLP expertise and a dedicated dataset.
